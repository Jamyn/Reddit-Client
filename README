Reddit-API

Reddit::API provides a perl wrapper for the Reddit API, allowing
basic services such as login, retrieval of stories and comments,
voting, and publishing new links and comments (TODO).

Please regard this software is beta and incomplete. Many files are
default skeletons. However, some functionality is complete:

  * Log in
  * List your reddits
  * Search reddits
  * Get listing for reddits
  * Get comments for link
  * Post comment / reply
  * Post link | text
  * Save/unsave link
  * Hide/unhide
  * Voting
  
Still to do:
  * Make saving/loading sessions more flexible
  * Unit tests
  * cleanup
  	--replace api strings with constants
  	--replace api-defined parameter strings (e.g. kind=link|self) with constants
