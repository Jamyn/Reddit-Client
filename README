Reddit-API

Reddit::API provides a perl wrapper for the Reddit API, allowing
basic services such as login, retrieval of stories and comments,
voting, and publishing new links and comments (TODO).

This module is currently in development. Many files are Module::Builder
skeletons. However, some functionality is complete:

  * Log in
  * List your reddits
  * Vote
  * Search reddits
  * Get listing for reddits
  * Get comments for link
  * Post comment / reply
  * Post link | text
  * Save/unsave link
  * Hide/unhide
  
Still to do:
  * Make saving/loading sessions more flexible
  * Unit tests
  * Comments
  * perldoc
  * cleanup
  	--replace api strings with constants
  	--replace api-defined parameter strings (e.g. kind=link|self) with constants
  	--make classes' mehtods proxies of API class
